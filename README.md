- **Data Source**: Uber Fares Dataset (from Kaggle)
- **Tools Used**:
  - Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
  - Power BI (Visualization & Dashboard)
- **Key Deliverables**:
  - Cleaned and feature-enhanced dataset
  - Interactive Power BI Dashboard
  - Analytical Report with findings & recommendations

## ðŸ“Š Workflow

1. **Data Loading & Cleaning (Python)**  
   - Removed missing and invalid values
   - Dropped outliers in fare amounts
   - Ensured correct data types

2. **Feature Engineering (Python)**  
   - Extracted pickup hour, day, month, weekday
   - Created peak/off-peak and weekend indicators

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (Python)**  
   - Distribution of fares (histograms, boxplots)
   - Correlation between fare and distance/time
   - Peak ride times & busiest days

4. **Dashboard Creation (Power BI)**  
   - Fare distribution histogram
   - Average fare by hour of day
   - Rides by day of week
   - Peak vs off-peak pie chart
   - Monthly trends analysis
   - Interactive filters and slicers
